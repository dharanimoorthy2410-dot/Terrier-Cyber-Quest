# Quantum-Enhanced AI for Ransomware Early Detection  

## Abstract  
This project proposes a hybrid AI + Quantum Machine Learning model for detecting ransomware behavior **before encryption starts**.  
It combines host signals (processes, registry, file ops) with network traces (DNS, TLS metadata) to achieve sub-second anomaly alerts.
